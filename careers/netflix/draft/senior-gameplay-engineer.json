Invention is part of our DNA at Spry Fox. Whether it‚Äôs by designing MMOs that encourage the development of friendships and discourage toxicity, or by designing unique puzzle games that promote English language learning; we‚Äôre always asking ourselves ‚Äúhow does this game improve your life?‚Äù\n\nSpry Fox strives to be a studio that is a pleasure to work for, an important but not dominating part of your life, and recognizes crunch is a negative, counter-productive industry practice ‚Äî something to be learned from and avoided in the future. We want you to have friends, family, hobbies, and a life outside of work. We want you to love your colleagues and know that they support you 100%. We want you to be proud of what you do and how you do it.\n\nFor 10+ years, we‚Äôve been fully remote with Foxes scattered all over the world. To make that work well, we all try to be online and communicative from 10am to 2pm PST to ensure that we have enough overlapping work hours with our team; otherwise, our schedules are flexible and fully under our individual control!\n\nNow that we‚Äôre a part of Netflix, we can do what we love with more support and without having to worry about how to monetize! We‚Äôve always been focused on making thoughtful, original games‚Ä¶ now more than ever.¬†\n\nABOUT THE JOB\nSpry Fox is looking for a Senior Gameplay Engineer to help us build an original, non-violent MMO.\n\nYou will be responsible for building and maintaining gameplay and content systems and data-driven tooling in Unreal Engine, with a focus on the moment to moment or ‚Äúgame-feel‚Äù aspects of the project. You‚Äôll work closely with the design team and rest of the engineering team to translate designs into polished player experiences and high performance client and server code.\n","requirements":[],"extras":[{"title":"REQUIREMENTS","content":["You‚Äôve been responsible for bringing moment to moment gameplay (e.g. controls, character, camera) to a shipping quality level.","You‚Äôve shipped a multiplayer project.","Strong C++ programming and debugging skills.","Strong communication skills that will help you succeed in a remote team environment.","Recent professional experience with Unreal and a deep understanding of game engine components and architecture."]},{"title":"NICE TO HAVE","content":["Animation programming experience.","Shipped at least one title that supported touch as well as keyboard & mouse for input.","Experience building data-driven tooling together with a designer.","Prior live service development experience.","Experience with, or interest in, automated testing."]}],"location_emoji":"üá∫üá∏"}

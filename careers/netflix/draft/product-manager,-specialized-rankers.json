Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want anytime, anywhere and can change their plans at any time.  \n\nPersonalization permeates almost every aspect of the Netflix product experience: From adapting the UI‚Äôs layout to member tastes, recommending the most delightful content, to showing the most helpful title images and trailers to help members choose better - machine learning is essential to how members enjoy our service.\n\nWe are looking for a Product manager to both advance our existing personalization capabilities in the member experience and to build new algorithmically powered experiences that will delight our members, with a focus on specific contexts like ranking titles a member has previously interacted with, or recommendations related to a specific context like ‚ÄúMore Like This‚Äù.¬†\n\nLeveraging available data, you will craft and communicate a strategic roadmap and see to its execution leading cross-functional teams of the industry‚Äôs best data scientists, machine learning and software engineers. You will work in close partnership with the member experience product management team, design, consumer insights and other functions to bring your vision to life and drive transformational change of the product experience. As a high-leverage thought leader, you will have the ability to shape our thinking on how to evolve our product, and have a massive impact on how members enjoy our service.¬†\n\nThis role is based in our Los Gatos office (preferred) in a hybrid model, but we are open to remote candidates who are on the West Coast. Some travel to Los Gatos will be required.\n\nWho will be successful in this role?\nYou combine a deep technical background in e.g. statistics, econometrics, or machine learning with a strong product sense and excellent communication skills to define, explain and execute your vision. You naturally gravitate towards experimentation as a way to validate your hypotheses while having a healthy skepticism when interpreting experimental results. In order to be successful in this position, you need to be able to work with world-class engineers, have the statistical acumen to collaborate with top-notch data scientists and the business sense to drive product goals and strategies. Demonstrated ability to build successful consumer facing applications and algorithms, and a strong feel for the entertainment business are big pluses.¬†\n\n","requirements":[],"extras":[{"title":"What we offer","content":["The opportunity to have impact.

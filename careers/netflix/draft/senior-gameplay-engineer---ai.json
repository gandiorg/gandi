We envision this role to start as an individual core contributor, writing code, building tools, and defining workflows and asset pathways to quickly achieve a gameplay prototype that delivers conviction around the game concept. This role will eventually grow into leading a small team of gameplay AI engineers to launch and support the game on the Netflix game service.\n\nAs our Senior Gameplay AI Engineer, you will have strong gameplay and design sensibilities along with solid engineering fundamentals. You will leverage your hands-on game prototyping expertise to implement in the short term, and bring industry-leading technical expertise to our team as the product matures over time. You have a bias towards action and are energized by the learnings that come with bold experimentation at an agile pace.\n\nWe're building the foundation for a small, yet ambitious, team of creators. As a team, we deeply care about the experiences we create, and more importantly who we're creating them with.  As a part of Netflix, we strive to hire the best and value integrity, excellence, respect, inclusion, and collaboration. Now is an amazing time to join Netflix as we seek to entertain the world.

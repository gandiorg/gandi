Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen, all without commercials or commitments. As Netflix continues to scale across the globe, we are creating and licensing an ever growing catalog of content. We strive to launch and recommend each title on our service in a personalized way, to help each member find the best titles to enjoy.


The Member Experience Foundations team is part of our Consumer Engineering organization, working alongside ML researchers and distributed systems engineers. The team builds and operates systems focused on enabling the configuration, serving and monitoring of Netflix discovery experiences. Each experience has millions of configurations, and is algorithmically surfaced on dozens of canvases that we are continually innovating. The Foundations team supports the behavior of our pages and content on the product, and ensures each experience is a success.


Leading this central effort, you will play a highly cross-functional role partnering with content, analytics, product management, application, machine learning, and data teams to ensure services are working in the most efficient, scalable and performant manner possible. You will develop tools and metrics that will improve our systems efficiency and enable them to scale.

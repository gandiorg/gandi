From “Healing Romance” to “Family-Friendly Variety Shows,” the system that powers Netflix’s multitudes of personalized row recommendations is the result of years of painstaking content analysis, intricate taxonomical work, data science, and pure movie and television geekery.

If you are an avid fan and a serious consumer of visual entertainment, the Editorial Creative team at Netflix is seeking a unique candidate who can capture the essence of movies, series, and specials — and turn that into data and information. This starts with digging deep into every assigned title, researching, tagging, rating, and enhancing other pieces of metadata that will help connect our members to the content they’ll love. 

This role will join a team of classification experts: people who can identify, collect and transform the artistic qualities of movies and series into the data that powers personalization for more than 240 million people around the world. This hire innately understands the facets, tropes, and themes that allow audiences around the world to laugh, think, escape, cry, and tell their friends, “You have to watch this.” 

The ideal candidate has a deep and broad knowledge and experience of visual media and is passionate about global entertainment. They can succinctly and broadly communicate what’s important about a piece of content, and why. They are comfortable working in a high-volume, high-quality, deadline- and data-driven environment. They are an excellent cross-functional partner who can relay the importance of this work to colleagues beyond your team, as well as collaborate on unique projects that use tags, metadata, and content insights in new and engaging user experiences on the Netflix service.

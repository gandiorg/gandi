Localization at Netflix is centered around linguistic excellence, a great team environment, and cutting edge technology. We are responsible for the translation and cultural adaptation of everything Netflix creates, from beautiful user interfaces to cinematic original programming. Our work is not just about translation, it is about providing our users with an experience that feels local.

Netflix is a global product and our Localization team needs to scale to support that. We are currently looking for a Technical Localization Project Manager to help bring the Netflix experience to international markets.

As a Technical Localization Project Manager, you work with one or more Localization Program Managers for our different product components (business areas). You are responsible for all elements of the localization workflow from ideation to job completion for an AB test, feature productization or supporting effort.

A successful candidate is a highly motivated individual who thrives when working autonomously in a fast-paced and constantly evolving environment. They passionately collaborate and problem solve. They have a demonstrated ability to manage priorities and projects and have the right mix of organizational and communication skills.

The Team
At Netflix, our mission is to Entertain the World.  Over 230 million members around the globe enjoy our award-winning movies and TV shows, but much of our growth still lies ahead. 

Our team is part of an organization that is responsible for driving the growth of Netflix’s subscriber base. Our work helps users discover Netflix, sign up for Netflix, and maintain their Netflix service.  We measure our team's success in the company's quarterly revenue.

Our team sits at the heart of all growth initiatives and at the intersection of product development and platform innovation. We find satisfaction in pioneering product features on emerging technologies and establishing code patterns for the entire organization. We take pride in owning all productized experiences in the growth space by consistently looking for opportunities to raise product quality and pay down tech debt.

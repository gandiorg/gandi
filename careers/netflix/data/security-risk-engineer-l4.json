At Netflix, we continue to challenge the traditional risk assessment and modeling approach. Our strategic bet around risk quantification shapes our decision-making and guides us in prioritizing risk responses and control design. Our risk program is looking for a new team member as we continue helping the business increase their confidence and ability to:

- use data analysis to improve decision making
- provide data visualization to decision-makers to reduce uncertainty,
- and understand optimal techniques to respond to technology risk

To support our investment in this space, we need to take smart risks, and you will enable Netflix to lean into those smart risks by expanding a program that promotes risk quantification, statistical models, and impact analysis to increase our confidence in risk response activities. We are looking for thoughtful data-oriented professionals to enable our mission and support our inclusive culture. In this role, you will help establish and execute a broad strategic vision for the risk program at Netflix. You will not only work within the team but also cross-functionally with various teams across the organization.

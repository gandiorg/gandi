                "description": "THE CHALLENGE
Eventbrite's business continues to grow and scale rapidly, powering millions of events. Event creators and event goers need reliable tools and technologies that empower their live experiences. In turn, Eventbrite’s development teams need effective tools and techniques for testing and delivering high quality products. Software Developers in Test (SDET) are Eventbrite’s center of excellence for software quality and are responsible for leading the adoption and implementation of world class automated testing solutions. You will work both within a centralized test automation-focused team, and as support to other development teams as they implement testing frameworks and expand test coverage. 

THE TEAM
The members of our team tackle big problems through small group collaboration. Our technology spans web, mobile, APIs, big data and machine learning, search, as well as physical point of sale and ticket scanning systems. As a people-focused organization, we support a culture of inclusion, mentorship, and continuous learning. Pair programming, weekly demos, tech talks, and hackathons are at the core of how we build our team and product. We engage with the community by hosting events with exciting technical speakers and releasing key building blocks of our stack as open-source software. We’re currently working through a transition to a pure Devops culture. We strive for teams to be completely autonomous and to have full ownership of their services and roadmaps. This includes requirements gathering,  deployment, maintenance - and testing!

THE ROLE
Establishing a culture of testing, test automation frameworks, and supporting the development of automated tests is the role of SDETs at Eventbrite. Our mission is to deliver the highest possible software quality by making writing and maintaining tests easy. To make this happen, typical activities include:
